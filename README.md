Guide:

1. Install nodejs
https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/

2. Make sure you have Node and NPM installed by running simple commands to see what version of each is installed:

Test Node. To see if Node is installed, open the Windows Command Prompt, Powershell or a similar command line tool, and type node -v. This should print the version number so you’ll see something like this v0.10.35.
Test NPM. To see if NPM is installed, type npm -v in Terminal. This should print the version number so you’ll see something like this 1.4.28

3. Open Terminal:

npm install cypress

npx cypress open
